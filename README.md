 
#### ----------- Create a README file to answer the following question----------


#### Question -1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?

#### Answer =>  
[VAR] - is an older version. It works inside the function and it is not follow the block. It can redeclare into the same name. It can hoisting. It should be avoided in modern JS.

[LET] - is a new version of ES6. It follows block scoped. It can't redeclare into the same name. It can also hoisting but if we use temporal dead zone first it shows ERROR.

[CONST] - is works just like LET. but it is immutable.It cannot be redeclared or updated. 




#### 2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?

#### Answer => 
[map()] - is working for every element and return a new array with the transformed values. But nothing change to the main array. It uses when we want a new array from the main array.

[forEach()] - is looping through every elements of an array abd executes a function. but it does not return a new array. It always returns undefined.

[filter()] - is a conditional term. It choose the elements according to the condition and return the new array which has fulfil the condition. Usually it works for DATA Filtering.




#### 3) What are arrow functions in ES6?

#### Answer =>
[ARROW functions in ES6] - are a shorter version of a function. It is more clear, shorter and easy version. In arrow function we doesn't need the function keyword. If the function body has only one line, we donâ€™t need to write return, it is ( implicit ). In this arrow function ( This ) behaves differently.( This) can change in normal function  but in arrow function ( This ) takes the value from its parent scope. It uses in modern JS.




#### 4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?

#### Answer =>
[destructuring assignment] - is a feature of ES6. We can collect the value form arrays or objects easily for this. We can set different elements of an array in separate variables. We can also set object properties to variables. If there is no value we can set a default value. It is also possible to take the value from Nested object or array.




#### 5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?

#### Answer =>
[template literals] - is a new feature of ES6. It uses backticks (``) to write strings. We can write string easily. We can also write variable or expression with ${ } this. We can write Multi-line string easily. It makes the code cleaner and readable.

DIFFERENTS - [String Concatenation] is an older version. If we need the variable and string - we have to use ( + )sign to join strings and variables. But [template literals] need just backticks (``) and ${ } this for variables or expressions. No need the (+)sign. 
In short [Template Literals] are a modern version also easier and cleaner and more powerful way to work with strings compared to [String Concatenation].
